# AI-Powered Sales Onboarding Crew

An end-to-end automated sales onboarding workflow built using the crewAI agentic framework.

This system uses specialized AI agents to handle lead research, enrichment, scoring, CRM setup, billing, scheduling, logging, and notifications â€” all orchestrated in a structured, modular flow.

## How It Works

Each agent in the crew is configured with:
- A defined role and backstory
- One or more tools (custom or CrewAI-compatible)
- A task that processes structured input and produces structured output

The agents work sequentially (or concurrently if configured), passing validated data between each stage using CrewAI's task context.
